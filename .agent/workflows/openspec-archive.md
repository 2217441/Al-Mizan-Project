# OpenSpec: Archive Workflow

Use this workflow after a feature has been successfully implemented and verified.

## Instructions
1.  **Update documentation**: Ensure `README.md` or other docs reflect the change.
2.  **Move proposal**: Move the proposal from `docs/proposals/` to `docs/archive/`.
3.  **Clean up**: Remove temporary files or artifacts created during implementation.
