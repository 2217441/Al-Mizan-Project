## Current Understanding

### Product Stage
- **Current Phase:** Phase 1 (Revitalized): Foundation & Hypothesis Proving.
- **Status:** *Incomplete* - Stakeholders unsatisfied with current proof of value.
- **Next Phase:** Phase 2: "Cyborg Isnad" (On Hold until Phase 1 validated).
- **Goal:** Conclusively prove that Graph > Relational for Isnad analysis through superior UX.

### User Segments
- **Primary (P0 - Immediate):**
  - **FYP Evaluators:** Tech-savvy, judging architectural soundness.
  - **Academic Researchers:** Need complex query capabilities for Isnad analysis.
- **Secondary (P1 - Phase 2):**
  - **Islamic Scholars:** "God Mode" users for validating relationships.
  - **Student Verifiers:** Gamified users ("Tinder for Hadith" style) for edge verification.
  - **Developers:** API consumers.

### Business Goals
- Prove hypothesis (Graph > Relational).
- Create a "Semantic Middleware" for the Islamic digital ecosystem.
- Achieve scalable verification through AI + Human-in-the-loop (Cyborg model).
- Gamify the verification process ("Micro-Waqf").

### Existing Insights & Challenges
- **Performance:** Graph query latency is excellent (<10ms).
- **Challenge:** Data verification is the bottleneck. Automated pipelines need a human layer.
- **Design Challenge:** Creating a "Tinder for Hadith" interface that is intuitive for students yet rigorous enough for data integrity.
- **Design Challenge:** "God Mode" dashboard for scholars to manage high-level trust and disputes.

### Research Focus Areas
1. **Verification Interface ("Tinder for Hadith"):** Usability testing for rapid decision making without error.
2. **Scholar Dashboard:** Workflow analysis for verified scholars.
3. **Gamification Mechanics:** Researching what motivates students to contribute (Reputation vs. Altruism).
