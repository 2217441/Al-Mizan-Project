## Executive Summary
**Goal**: Build a graph-based platform for traversing and verifying semantic relationships in knowledge sources.
**Core Value**: "Traceable Truth" – Ensuring the integrity of knowledge derivation through graph verification.

## Current Status: "Stabilization & Optimization"
The project is currently in the late stages of **Phase 1 (Foundation)**.
- **Reference**: See [Project Schedule](../PROJECT_SCHEDULE.md) for Phase 1b timeline.
- **Key Focus**: Integrating SFIA for Agent Capabilities while stabilizing the Core Graph.

## Success Metrics (KPIs)
1.  **Graph Integrity**: 100% of Quranic Nodes (`quran_verse`) linked to Morphology Roots.
2.  **Agent Capability**: Agents can successfully retrieve and utilize "SFIA Skill Definitions" from `data/sfia/`.
3.  **Governance**: 100% of Architectural Decisions logged in `docs/adr/`.

## Objectives (Immediate - Phase 1b)
1.  **Optimize Phase 1**: Address stakeholder feedback on the current Foundation.
    - Improve Data Ingestion reliability.
    - Refine Graph Ontology.
2.  **Rescue Frontend**: Audit the current UI and plan the necessary enhancements to satisfy internal visual standards requirements privately.
3.  **Roadmap Alignment**: Unify the fragmented roadmaps into a single, accurate source of truth.

## Key Stakeholders
- **Project Lead**: Demands high aesthetic standards and functional perfection.
- **Users**: Require an intuitive interface for interacting with the graph.

## Roadmap Overview (Consolidated)
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: 🚧 **In Progress**
    - Core Knowledge Graph & ETL.
    - *Needs*: Optimization & User Feedback Integration.
- **Phase 2 (Verification)**: **Planned**
    - OCR Pipeline & Verification UI.
- **Phase 3 (Analysis)**: **Future**
    - Advanced Analytics & API.
