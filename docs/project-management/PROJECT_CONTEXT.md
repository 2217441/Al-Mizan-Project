# Project Context: Al-Mizan

## Executive Summary
**Goal:** Build a graph-based platform for traversing and verifying semantic relationships in knowledge sources.
**Core Value:** "Traceable Truth" – Ensuring the integrity of knowledge derivation through graph verification.

## Current Status: "Stabilization & Optimization"
The project is currently in the late stages of **Phase 1 (Foundation)** but requires significant optimization and alignment.
- **Backend**: Core graph infrastructure (Rust/SurrealDB) is in place but needs validation.
- **Frontend**: Basic data visualization exists. Needs to evolve into a robust verification interface to meet stakeholder expectations.
- **Documentation**: Needs consolidation to reflect the current state accurately.

## Objectives (Immediate - Phase 1b)
1.  **Optimize Phase 1**: Address stakeholder feedback on the current Foundation.
    - Improve Data Ingestion reliability.
    - Refine Graph Ontology.
2.  **Rescue Frontend**: Audit the current UI and plan the necessary enhancements to satisfy internal visual standards requirements privately.
3.  **Roadmap Alignment**: Unify the fragmented roadmaps into a single, accurate source of truth.

## Key Stakeholders
- **Project Lead**: Demands high aesthetic standards and functional perfection.
- **Users**: Require an intuitive interface for interacting with the graph.

## Roadmap Overview (Consolidated)
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: 🚧 **In Progress**
    - Core Knowledge Graph & ETL.
    - *Needs*: Optimization & User Feedback Integration.
- **Phase 2 (Verification)**: **Planned**
    - OCR Pipeline & Verification UI.
- **Phase 3 (Analysis)**: **Future**
    - Advanced Analytics & API.
