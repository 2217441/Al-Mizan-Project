# Al-Mizan: The Sovereign Master Index

This document is the **authoritative entry point** for the Al-Mizan architectural ecosystem. It serves as both the technical registry and the theological constitution, linking high-level Shariah principles to their definitive technical specifications.

---

## 🏛️ Architectural Governance

To ensure the Al-Mizan system remains "Living" and "Absolute," the following rules apply:

1.  **Truth in Code**: Every architectural specification MUST have a corresponding implementation in the repository.
2.  **Continuous Synchronization**: Any pull request changing core system logic MUST update its respective volume in `docs/charter/`.
3.  **Thematic Modularisation**: Specifications are partitioned into thematic volumes to ensure scalability and clarity.
4.  **Implementation Status**: All components are tagged with:
    - 🟢 `PROD`: Fully implemented and validated.
    - 🟡 `DEV`: Under active development.
    - ⚪ `CONC`: Conceptual/Research phase.

## 📖 Theological-Technical Alignment Matrix

The technical infrastructure is a direct manifestation of Shariah principles:

| Theological Pillar | Technical Implementation | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tawhid (Unity)** | Distributed OS / Unified Stack | Single source of truth across all nodes. |
| **Amanah (Trust)** | Audit Trails & Merkle Consensus | Absolute accountability for every ruling. |
| **Adalah (Justice)** | BFT Governance & Slashing | Preventing "Fitna" and weighted manipulation. |
| **Ijtihad (Reasoning)** | Agent Collaboration (Blackboard) | Verifiable scholarly synthesis. |
| **Thabit (Constancy)** | Immutable Storage (ZFS/Surreal) | Protection of primary revelation. |
