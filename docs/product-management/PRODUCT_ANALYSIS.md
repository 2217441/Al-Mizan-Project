# Product Context & Analysis

## Vision & Strategy

### Product Vision
To build the **definitive Semantic Knowledge Graph for Islamic digital resources**, solving "Epistemological Incongruence" by preserving complex theological relationships (Isnad, Tafsir, Istinbat) in a graph structure. Al-Mizan serves as the verified "Semantic Middleware" between raw texts and future EdTech/Research applications.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Graph-based Traversal**: Moving beyond "bag of words" search to $O(1)$ relationship lookups.
- **Epistemological Clarity**: Distinguishing between *Thabit* (Immutable/Verified) and *Zanni* (Probabilistic) nodes.
- **Secure Foundation**: A strict "Sandbox Protocol" ensuring data integrity and preventing "data poisoning".

### Business Model
- **Current**: Academic FYP (Final Year Project) serving Researchers and Evaluators.
- **Future**: B2B API licensing for EdTech; "Micro-Waqf" gamification for community verification.

## Target Users & Market

### Primary Users (P0 - Immediate)
- **FYP Evaluators**: Judging technical depth and architectural soundness.
- **Academic Researchers**: Needing complex query capabilities for Isnad analysis.

### Secondary Users (P1 - Phase 2)
- **Islamic Scholars**: For verifying relationships and ensuring accuracy.
- **Developers**: Building apps on top of the verified API.

### Market Landscape
- **Competitors**: Sunnah.com, Tanzil.net (Keyword based, no graph relationships).
- **Opportunity**: No existing open-source Graph API exists for traversing Isnad/Matn relationships with this level of granularity.

## Current Status (Phase 1b: Stabilization)
### Metrics
- **Performance**: Graph Query Latency < 10ms (Target < 50ms) ✅
- **Data Coverage**: 6,236 Quran Verses + ~2,000 Hadiths ✅
- **API Status**: 20+ Endpoints Live ✅
- **Verification**: Pipeline verification needed.

## Strategy: The "Rescue & Scale" Approach
We are currently in **Phase 1b**, focusing on:
1.  **Optimization**: Rescuing the frontend to meet "High Aesthetic" standards.
2.  **Stabilization**: Ensuring the foundation is solid before scaling to "Cyborg Isnad" (Phase 2).

### The "Cyborg Isnad" (Phase 2 - Upcoming)
To move from a static dataset to a living, verified graph, we must implement **Phase 2**, focusing on:
1.  **AI Extraction**: OCR/LLM drafting of edges.
2.  **Human Verification**: A scholar/student interface to validate edges.
3.  **Gamification**: Incentivizing verification through "Hasanat" points or similar.
