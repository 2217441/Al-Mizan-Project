# Strategic Directives: Product Management
> **Source**: Master Strategic Plan (2026-01-15)

## 1. The B2B Pivot
*   **Directive**: Shift focus from "Consumer App" to "Infrastructure Layer".
*   **Action**: Stop prioritizing the "Playground UI" for end-users. Start defining requirements for the **Enterprise API** (Phase 18).
*   **Target Persona**: Islamic Fintech CTOs, Legal Tech Startups, AI Researchers.

## 2. "Intel Inside" Strategy
*   **Directive**: Do not compete with Super Apps (Noor, MuslimPro). Power them.
*   **Action**: Define specs for "Drop-in Widgets" (e.g., `almizan-badge.js`) that allow 3rd parties to display "Verified by Al-Mizan".

## 3. Future Vision
*   **Directive**: Prepare for eventual Open Sourcing of the "Epistemological Engine".
*   **Constraint**: Ensure the "Islamic Data" remains governed/closed, while the "Logic Engine" becomes universal.
