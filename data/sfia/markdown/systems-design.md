###  Revision notes
**Updates for SFIA 9**
  * Theme(s) influencing the updates for this skill: Application of SFIA skills for cloud-based working, Making SFIA easier to consume (enhance readability/guidance/descriptions), Making SFIA easier to consume (new levels), Cyber physical systems.
  * New level 2 added to support entry-level roles.
  * You can move to SFIA 9 when you are ready - SFIA 8 skill descriptions will still be available to use.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
A system is a structured arrangement of components, both physical and digital, designed to work together to meet specific requirements, considering factors such as scalability, security, human interaction and adherence to organisational and regulatory standards.
Systems design activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * using design concepts to develop a systems design and provide the basis for systems construction and verification
  * designing or selecting system components
  * designing systems compatible with contemporary computing architectures and selection of components such as cloud computing service models and edge computing
  * designing cyber-physical systems that integrate computational and physical components
  * considering human factors and socio-technical aspects when designing systems that involve significant human interaction
  * developing a complete set of detailed models, properties and/or characteristics described in a form suitable for implementation
  * adopting and adapting of system design lifecycle models based on the context of the work using predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches for system design
  * adhering to regulatory requirements and organisational standards including security.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
