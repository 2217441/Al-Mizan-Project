###  Revision notes
**Updates for SFIA 9**
  * Theme(s) influencing the updates for this skill: Continued refinement for AI/ML Ops skills, Making SFIA easier to consume (enhance readability/guidance/descriptions), Making SFIA easier to consume (updates to skill name/skill description).
  * Readability improvements have been made to levels 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
  * You can move to SFIA 9 when you are ready - SFIA 8 skill descriptions will still be available to use.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * assessing the suitability of machine learning for business problems
  * selecting and applying appropriate machine learning techniques, algorithms and tools to solve business problems
  * preparing data for machine learning, including cleansing, transformation and feature engineering
  * designing, training, optimising and retraining models using supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning
  * managing MLOps for model deployment, monitoring and lifecycle management
  * evaluating models for performance, robustness, fairness and bias, and selecting metrics to assess outcomes
  * diagnosing and resolving issues before and after deployment
  * anticipating organisational implications, including ethics, bias, privacy, sustainability and data protection
  * establishing traceability for outcomes produced by machine learning systems
  * implementing continuous learning mechanisms to ensure models adapt to new data and changing environments, including real-time adaptation to new inputs and evolving conditions.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
