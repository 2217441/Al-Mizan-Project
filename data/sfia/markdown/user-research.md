### Guidance notes
This skill is inclusive of a full range of user tasks not just digital tasks. The skill can be applied in various contexts, such as, but not limited to customer experience, products, services, applications, devices, learning experience and employee experience.
User research has a different set of responsibilities to academic research or user requirements elicitation. User research incorporates significant involvement of users to generate deep understanding and uncover new opportunities for systems, products, services or devices. 
Activities may include, but are not limited to: 
  * using ethnography, observation techniques, task analysis and other methodologies that incorporate both the social and technological context
  * quantifying different user populations and their needs
  * identifying target users and segments to maximise the chances of design success for systems, products, services or devices
  * analysing and synthesising research data to generate actionable insights
  * communicating research findings effectively to various stakeholders
  * including a range of users in research activities to capture the diversity of users' behaviours, needs and motivations.
