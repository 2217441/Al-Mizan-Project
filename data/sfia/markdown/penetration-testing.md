### Guidance notes
Penetration testing may be a stand-alone activity or an aspect of acceptance testing prior to an approval to operate.
Activities include, but are not limited to:
  * ethical hacking (using the same tools and techniques as an adversary to safely exploit security weaknesses)
  * demonstrating how an adversary can subvert security goals or achieve specific adversarial objectives
  * evaluating the effectiveness of current/planned defences or mitigation controls
  * assuring the security of networks, systems and applications
  * assessing the strength and effectiveness of cryptographic implementations
  * identifying insights into the business risks of various vulnerabilities
  * testing network, infrastructure, web and mobile applications for weaknesses
  * checking patch levels and configurations
  * social engineering.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
