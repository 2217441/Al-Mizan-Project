### Guidance notes
This skill is typically applied to the design and deployment of configurations of large, complex software.
This includes, but is not limited to:
  * enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) software
  * server/mainframe operating systems
  * software as a service (SaaS) solutions
  * integration platforms/suites
  * tools provided by infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) providers.


Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * porting software configurations across different environments or platforms
  * refactoring complex or overlapping configurations across different software modules and capabilities
  * designing and implementing configurations that use architectures and services like microservices, serverless and containers
  * optimising configurations for performance, scalability and cost-efficiency
  * managing configurations across multiple environments and ensuring interoperability
  * applying infrastructure as code principles to automate configuration deployment and management.


Depending on requirements and the characteristics of the project or assigned work, software configuration methods and lifecycles can be predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.
###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels.
