### Guidance notes
This skill is applied in contexts where consistent categorisation of information is required to enable the data to be used reliably and effectively. This may include, but is not limited to, clinical coding, data labelling for machine learning, legal coding/indexing and market research coding.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * analysing and interpreting information based on domain-specific knowledge
  * assigning codes, labels or categories based on specific standards, guidelines or frameworks
  * ensuring accuracy and consistency of coding/labelling through quality assurance activities
  * collaborating with subject matter experts to clarify ambiguous cases and improve coding/labelling guidelines
  * providing guidance and training to others on coding/labelling practices
  * contributing to the development and improvement of coding/labelling systems, guidelines and processes.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
