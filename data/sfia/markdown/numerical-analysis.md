  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Numerical analysis is the area of mathematics and computer science that creates, analyses and implements algorithms for numerically solving mathematical problems. Numerical analysis is required for applications including, but not limited to:
  * simulations of physical systems
  * machine learning
  * data analytics 


Numerical analysis is concerned with:
  * floating-point arithmetic and the resulting accumulation of rounding errors (integer arithmetic which has different considerations)
  * consideration of the numerical stability, condition numbers, accuracy, computational complexity and usability of algorithms that solve mathematical problems.


Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * developing and implementing numerical algorithms
  * analysing and optimising the efficiency of numerical methods
  * evaluating and improving the accuracy of computational results
  * collaborating with domain experts to apply numerical solutions to real-world problems
  * documenting and communicating complex numerical concepts to non-specialists.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
