### Guidance notes
This skill entails developing and using specialist knowledge to offer authoritative advice and direction, distinct from general guidance or troubleshooting.
Professional advice is the provision of expert, objective and evidence-based recommendations, guidance and solutions to address specific challenges or opportunities, drawing upon the advisor's in-depth knowledge, skills and experience. 
Expertise may cover a particular aspect of information or communications technology, digital practices, methodologies, or application areas and can extend to applying knowledge from other disciplines, such as legal, finance, public relations, ethics or human resources, to technology-related topics.
Activities include, but are not limited to:
  * research and analysis to stay current with the latest developments in the specialist area
  * providing subject matter expert advice and recommendations based on thorough understanding of the subject
  * collaborating with other specialists to ensure comprehensive and cohesive advice
  * clearly communicating complex information to non-experts

  * providing mentorship and guidance to support the development of specialist knowledge within the organisation.
