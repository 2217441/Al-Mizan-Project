###  Revision notes
**Updates for SFIA 9**
  * Content changes have been made to levels 2, 3, and 4.
  * Guidance notes have been updated to reference contemporary examples and applications of the skill
  * You can move to SFIA 9 when you are ready - SFIA 8 skill descriptions will still be available to use.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Embedded systems provide dedicated functionality within a larger mechanical or electronic system, often with constraints related to real-time performance, safety, security, and reliability. These systems typically interface with hardware, sensors, and actuators, supporting critical operations in industrial, automotive, aerospace, medical, or robotic equipment, as well as in IoT (Internet of Things) devices and intelligent systems.
These systems usually perform essential functions and have strict requirements for integrity, reliability, safety, security, and power consumption.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * defining non-functional system requirements such as performance, reliability, safety, and security, as well as constraints like power, cost, physical space, or response time
  * building in fail-safe or secure characteristics to support graceful degradation
  * applying specialised techniques to ensure systems meet their critical attributes
  * employing comprehensive methods for validation, verification, and testing
  * using virtual or model-based development approaches to simulate, test, and optimise systems throughout the development lifecycle
  * using specialised tools for real-time program and system analysis, validation, and debugging.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
