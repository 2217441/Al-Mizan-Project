### Guidance notes
Workforce planning typically takes an enterprise-wide view, assessing capabilities across the organisation rather than just a single team. The scope is more strategic than tactical resource allocation to projects or operational work schedules.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * assessing the current state of the workforce
  * assessing organisation-wide data over extended time periods to discover multi-year trends
  * identifying critical capabilities needed to compete and meet strategic goals, not just immediate resource allocation gaps
  * identifying the workforce required for current and future activities 
  * adopting or developing a skills and capabilities framework
  * developing plans to close gaps between current state and future state using actions such as, but not limited to: external recruitment, internal development, re-skilling, sourcing external partners, organisational design or outplacement 
  * influencing organisational policies and practices to align recruitment, learning, promotion, and recognition and reward to support the development of an inclusive and diverse workforce 
  * adhering to relevant regulations and ethical standards concerning employment practices and organisational policies, including requirements related to layoffs and restructuring.
