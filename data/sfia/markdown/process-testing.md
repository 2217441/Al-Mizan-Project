### Guidance notes
Process testing focuses on ensuring systems effectively support business processes, deliver value and meet user needs.
It involves identifying and mitigating risks such as inefficient or error-prone processes, unsupported user roles, restricted user actions, system complexity, inconsistent data handling and non-compliance with business requirements.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * collaborating with stakeholders to align testing with business requirements and objectives
  * designing test cases that cover entire business workflows, including business rules, alternate paths and exception scenarios
  * setting up test environments that simulate real-world conditions, user roles and data flows
  * preparing and managing test data to accurately support the scenarios being tested
  * executing manual and automated tests to validate workflows, ensuring systems operate correctly across scenarios
  * logging and reporting findings with an emphasis on business process impact, providing insights and recommendations
  * analysing results to identify inefficiencies and areas for system and process enhancement
  * promoting a shift-left approach by integrating process testing early in the lifecycle for early issue detection
  * developing and maintaining scalable automation frameworks
  * ensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and recognised good practices.
