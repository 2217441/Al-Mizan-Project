### Guidance notes
Technology infrastructure encompasses a wide range of components including, but not limited to: physical devices, virtual resources, cloud services, infrastructure-related software, middleware, network services and data storage solutions.
The skill involves defining the components and services that make up the technology environment, their connections, interrelationships and operating parameters, which together ensure infrastructure solutions support current and future business needs.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * developing detailed infrastructure design specifications and diagrams
  * ensuring compatibility and integration between different infrastructure components
  * designing infrastructure for scalability, performance, reliability and security from the outset
  * ensuring designs adhere to industry standards, regulatory requirements and security protocols
  * collaborating with stakeholders to align infrastructure design with business objectives
  * maintaining comprehensive documentation of the design process and decisions
  * integrating cloud services into the infrastructure design.
