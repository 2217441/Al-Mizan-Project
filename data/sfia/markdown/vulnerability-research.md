### Guidance notes
A security vulnerability is a weakness, flaw or error found within a security system that has the potential to be leveraged by an external agent to compromise a secure system.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * researching new threats, attack vectors, risks and potential solutions
  * researching new or emerging cryptographic vulnerabilities 
  * reverse engineering hardware or software 
  * applying tools such as disassemblers, debuggers and fuzzers 
  * analysing embedded devices
  * developing techniques and tools to analyse and expose vulnerabilities
  * designing new vulnerability discovery techniques
  * sharing mitigation techniques with relevant stakeholders.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
