### Guidance notes
This skill is applicable to all project management techniques and lifecycles - which can be on a continuum from predictive (plan-driven) approaches to adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * selecting techniques and lifecycle models based on the context of the project
  * ensuring project activities align with governance frameworks and organisational standards
  * establishing team structures and a collaborative working environment
  * communicating with stakeholders and maintaining awareness of business needs and priorities
  * using visual techniques for project tracking and reporting 
  * timeboxing and incremental deliveries 
  * defining deliverables, milestones and dependencies
  * applying change control and risk management processes
  * acquiring the necessary resources and skills
  * agreeing constraints of cost, timescales, quality and scope
  * reviewing experiences and learning from current and previous projects
  * ensuring projects are formally closed and reviewed.


An understanding of project size and complexity is helpful when applying the project management skill. Typical factors that influence project complexity include the complexity of resourcing, scale of organisational impact, use of new technologies, number of interdependences, stability of requirements, business implications and risks.
