### Guidance notes
Competency assessment is a specialised practice for evaluating skills and competencies, distinct from performance appraisals and general capability understanding. Unlike performance reviews which focus on job performance and contributions, competency assessment objectively measures technical and professional capabilities.
Assessments may be conducted in various contexts, including: recruitment, career progression, professional development planning, or accreditation/certification.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * evaluating and selecting assessment options
  * adopting or adapting assessment methods, tools and techniques
  * considering the context of the assessment and how the results of the assessment will be used
  * aligning assessments with ethical, legal and regulatory requirements. 


Ethical, legal and regulatory requirements are essential for ensuring the integrity of assessments and protecting personal data.
