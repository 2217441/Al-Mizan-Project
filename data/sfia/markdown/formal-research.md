The Formal Research skill, as defined in SFIA, encompasses the systematic creation of new knowledge through rigorous methodologies, applicable across various sectors including, but not limited to, commercial research and development, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and non-profit organisations.
Because of its name, this skill can be confused with general search and investigation into a topic of interest. In most cases, general investigations are covered by responsibilities described by the SFIA generic attributes. Many of the SFIA professional skills also refer to investigation or similar activity.
