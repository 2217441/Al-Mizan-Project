  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
The scope of integration includes system elements, subsystems, interfaces and software components including computing, storage, networking and cloud services.
Systems integration is used to create systems for testing purposes as well as for operational use by customers and users.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * developing organisational capabilities, processes and procedures for automation and continuous integration of build, packaging, testing, security and deployment
  * building and operating a continuous integration (CI) capability when required, employing version control of source code and related artefacts
  * ensuring security and privacy requirements are an essential part of systems integration and build
  * collaborating with development, testing and operations teams to streamline the integration process
  * testing, validation and sign off of integration to satisfy requirements, architectures and design
  * monitoring and controlling integration activities and recording and reporting on the results of integration
  * keeping stakeholders informed and providing feedback into risk management processes
  * developing and testing disaster recovery plans and applying incident management processes for major systems integrations.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
