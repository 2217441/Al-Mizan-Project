### Guidance notes
Predominantly focused on the representation of processes, roles, data, organisation and time. Models may be used to represent a subject at varying levels of detail and decomposition.
Business models are typically created to communicate and provide insights into existing, conceptual or proposed scenarios. As such, they are likely to be working models that allow comparisons of alternative outcomes based on changing inputs and parameters.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * gathering and analysing business requirements
  * creating visual representations of business workflows, processes and structures
  * developing and testing simulation models
  * facilitating workshops to validate and refine models
  * presenting models to stakeholders and explaining their implications.


This skill shouldn't be applied to the creation of all diagrams related to describing and explaining business concepts. Refer to other SFIA skills, including, but not limited to: Business situation analysis, Business process improvement, Data design and modelling, Enterprise and business architecture, Organisation design.
