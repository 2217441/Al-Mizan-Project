### Guidance notes
This skill is primarily focused on enterprise-wide strategic planning and management, rather than developing strategies for specific technical or functional areas. For senior managers or individuals working on their own technical or functional strategies, this skill may be too broad and high-level. Instead, they may require more specific skills related to their particular domain or area of expertise.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * conducting environmental analyses to inform strategy development
  * collaborating with stakeholders to formulate and implement strategies and action plans
  * using data analytics and digital tools to support strategic decision-making and monitor progress
  * ensuring agility and flexibility in strategy execution to adapt to changing business needs
  * communicating and embedding strategic management through objectives, accountabilities and progress monitoring
  * continuously reviewing and iterating strategic plans to maintain alignment with business goals.
