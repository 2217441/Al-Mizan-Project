  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * defining the planned operation and maintenance of the solution within a production environment, including changes to services, processes, organisation and operating models as well as technology 
  * ensuring existing and planned solution components are compatible with relevant architectures, strategies, policies, standards and practices 
  * considering requirements for security, privacy and testing of solutions
  * taking account of relevant architectures, strategies, policies, standards and practices 
  * identifying appropriate cloud services, evaluating their cost implications and optimising for cost-efficiency
  * developing roadmaps to migrate components to cloud services
  * developing and communicating an implementation roadmap 
  * providing guidance and risk-based governance to support solution implementation including managing requests for changes and deviations from specifications.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels.
