### Guidance notes
The overall purpose of certification for individuals is to recognise their competence to perform a specific task or job, or to determine whether they have met certain knowledge criteria.
Knowledge and competence are distinct and the two terms should not be confused. A certification body is responsible for ensuring that only individuals who demonstrate competence are awarded certification.  
Certification of individuals provides value by building public confidence and trust. This confidence relies on a valid assessment of competence by a third party, which is reconfirmed at defined intervals. The certification body must act responsibly to provide confidence to interested parties in its competence, impartiality and integrity.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * verifying, upon request, whether an individual holds a valid certificate and the scope of that certification, except where legal restrictions apply
  * documenting security policies and procedures, including non-disclosure agreements or other measures to prevent the release of confidential examination materials or involvement in fraudulent practices
  * implementing procedures for certified individuals to inform the certification body of any changes that could affect their ability to continue meeting certification requirements.
