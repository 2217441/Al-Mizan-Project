### Guidance notes
Technology infrastructure encompasses a wide range of components including, but not limited to, physical devices, virtual resources, cloud services, infrastructure-related software, middleware, network services and data storage solutions.
Infrastructure operations also involves implementing automation, cybersecurity measures and the adoption of cloud technologies to enhance efficiency, security and agility.
These components may be on-premises, outsourced to third parties, or provisioned through cloud services.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * provisioning and adapting infrastructure components to meet the evolving needs of users and service providers
  * managing virtual, cloud and hybrid/multi-cloud environments
  * automating tasks through scripting, coding, orchestration tools and infrastructure as code (IaC) practices
  * ensuring infrastructure security through regular updates, patch management and adherence to cybersecurity policies and established industry practices
  * monitoring infrastructure performance and its impact on efficiency, performance, security posture and sustainability
  * collaborating with development teams (DevOps) 
  * using containerisation technologies to enhance application deployment and scalability.
