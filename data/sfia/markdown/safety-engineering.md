###  Revision notes
**Updates for SFIA 9**
  * Theme(s) influencing the updates for this skill: Making SFIA easier to consume (new levels).
  * New level 2 added to support entry-level roles.
  * You can move to SFIA 9 when you are ready - SFIA 8 skill descriptions will still be available to use.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Safety-critical systems are those in which a system failure could harm human life, other living things, physical structures, or the environment. 
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * safety hazard and risk analysis
  * safety requirements specification
  * safety-related systems architectural design
  * formal method design
  * safety validation and verification
  * safety case preparation
  * applying generic safety standards such as IEC 61508, IEC 61511 or industry-specific safety standards.


System safety is engineered and measured by safety levels based on hazard and risk analysis.
###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
