###  Revision notes
**Updates for SFIA 9**
  * Minor changes to content only.
  * You can move to SFIA 9 when you are ready - SFIA 8 skill descriptions will still be available to use.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Requirements may be related to software, systems, data, processes, products or services.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * eliciting and analysing requirements, both functional and non-functional
  * ensuring customer requirements, priorities and acceptance criteria are accurately captured and validated
  * organising and prioritising requirements using techniques such as, but not limited to, product roadmaps, epics, user stories and backlogs
  * specifying and validating requirements, constraints and acceptance criteria to a level that enables effective development and operations of new or changed software, systems, processes, products or services
  * negotiating trade-offs that are acceptable to key stakeholders and within budgetary, technical, regulatory and other constraints
  * adopting and adapting requirements management lifecycle models.


The requirements lifecycle approach will be based on the context of the work and may be selected from predictive (plan-driven) or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.
