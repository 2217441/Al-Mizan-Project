###  Revision notes
**Updates for SFIA 9**
  * Theme(s) influencing the updates for this skill: Making SFIA easier to consume (enhance readability/guidance/descriptions).
  * You can move to SFIA 9 when you are ready - SFIA 8 skill descriptions will still be available to use.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Scientific modelling involves applying computer simulation and other forms of computation to solve real-world problems in scientific disciplines.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * identifying relevant mathematical principles and scientific theory within a computational model
  * creating, testing and tuning scientific models through the application of computing
  * validating and interpreting computational models against the reality which the models attempt to represent
  * collaborating with domain experts to ensure models accurately represent scientific phenomena
  * communicating model results and implications to both technical and non-technical audiences
  * continuously refining models based on new data or scientific understanding
  * applying models to predict outcomes or test hypotheses in scientific research.


Scientific modelling is used across various fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, environmental science and social sciences, to simulate complex systems and processes.
###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.

###  Scientific modelling: Level 4
**[Level 4 - Enable](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-9/responsibilities/level-4):** Essence of the level: Performs diverse complex activities, supports and guides others, delegates tasks when appropriate, works autonomously under general direction, and contributes expertise to deliver team objectives. 
* * *
Analyses the real-world problem, then selects appropriate physical and mathematical models to approximate the phenomena under investigation. 
Applies relevant mathematical techniques to simulate the problem. 
Conducts quality and performance assessments on computational model outputs and makes improvements to the models. 
Provides advice and guidance to the users of these models.
###  Scientific modelling: Level 5
**[Level 5 - Ensure, advise](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-9/responsibilities/level-5):** Essence of the level: Provides authoritative guidance in their field and works under broad direction. Accountable for delivering significant work outcomes, from analysis through execution to evaluation. 
* * *
Investigates real-world problems to assess whether existing scientific models provide effective solutions. 
Creates new mathematical representations of the underlying science that can be implemented in a computational model. Applies advanced programming techniques to implement scientific models and apply these for problem-solving. 
Analyses the functioning of existing computational models to improve accuracy and performance. 
Communicates limitations such as uncertainty and systematic errors. Ensures appropriate usage of computational models.
###  Scientific modelling: Level 6
**[Level 6 - Initiate, influence](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-9/responsibilities/level-6):** Essence of the level: Has significant organisational influence, makes high-level decisions, shapes policies, demonstrates leadership, promotes organisational collaboration, and accepts accountability in key areas. 
* * *
Initiates the creation, testing, improvement and application of mathematical model frameworks representing real-world systems and scientific theories. 
Sets standards and approaches for the application of scientific modelling. 
Oversees the representation of science and mathematics principles and theories in models to ensure appropriate, consistent and effective usage. 
Develops or introduces new mathematical techniques where necessary.
###  Scientific modelling: Level 7
**[Level 7 - Set strategy, inspire, mobilise](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-9/responsibilities/level-7):** Essence of the level: Operates at the highest organisational level, determines overall organisational vision and strategy, and assumes accountability for overall success.
