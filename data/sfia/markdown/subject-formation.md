**Updates for SFIA 9**

  * You can move to SFIA 9 when you are ready - SFIA 8 skill descriptions will still be available to use.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Subject formation focuses on:
  * developing curricula to support the development of understanding of the principles, approaches and practices that underpin specific topics and knowledge areas 
  * incorporating significant emerging technologies and techniques for which current students need to be prepared. 


The scope may include curricula for formal education or for independent examination bodies.
This skill is generic and can be applied to curriculum design and development for any topic or knowledge area. In the context of the SFIA framework, this includes:
  * the topics and knowledge areas that support any skills described in the SFIA framework
  * and the application of these topics and knowledge areas to other disciplines and practices.


In the context of computing and IT curricula, the topics addressed are typically:
  * common digital skills needed to safely benefit from, participate in and contribute to the digital world for everyday life and for work
  * fundamental and more advanced aspects of specific topics and knowledge areas including emerging technologies and new applications for existing technologies
  * the ideas of computational thinking and the application of computational concepts to everyday life and professional working practices.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.
