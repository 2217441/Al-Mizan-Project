### Guidance notes
This skill involves interdisciplinary approaches to developing and operating software and systems across their entire lifecycle. Commonly associated with terms such as DevOps, DevSecOps, site reliability engineering, developer productivity engineering.
This skill extends beyond continuous improvement. It focuses on integrating technical practices and collaborative methods, automation and lifecycle processes essential for system reliability, security and operational excellence.
Activities include, but are not limited to:
  * establishing secure, reliable software lifecycle practices
  * developing a supporting framework of methods, tools, processes, procedures and skilled personnel
  * deploying this environment with teams responsible for developing and operating software and systems 
  * building repeatable, reliable capabilities through trial, feedback, learning and continual evolution
  * adapting practices to specific products and services
  * defining, controlling and improving lifecycle processes
  * incorporating risk management, quality, security, privacy and safety
  * maximising automation
  * establishing architecture and design principles to support lifecycle processes
  * focusing on mission, value and customer needs
  * cultivating a culture of collaboration, learning, adaptation and resilience
  * integrating industry frameworks to guide improvements.
