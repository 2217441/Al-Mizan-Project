###  Revision notes
**Updates for SFIA 9**
  * Theme(s) influencing the updates for this skill: Application of SFIA skills for cloud-based working, Making SFIA easier to consume (enhance readability/guidance/descriptions), Making SFIA easier to consume (new levels), Making SFIA easier to consume (updates to skill name/skill description).
  * New level 2 added to support entry-level roles.
  * Readability improvements have been made to levels 5 and 6.
  * You can move to SFIA 9 when you are ready - SFIA 8 skill descriptions will still be available to use.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
The scope encompasses a wide range of hardware systems and components, including but not limited to processors, specialised computing units, embedded systems, control systems and various sensor and actuator devices. The hardware design should factor in integration needs with IT infrastructures, networking environments, as well as systems architectures such as cloud service models, edge computing and cyber-physical systems.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * defining how hardware components fit into the system architecture and integrate with software, firmware and other systems
  * selecting, designing, specifying, integrating and prototyping hardware components and subsystems
  * considering target environments, performance, security, safety, reliability, sustainability and compatibility requirements
  * adhering to industry standards including compatibility, safety, security, reliability and sustainability.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.

###  Show/hide extra descriptions and levels.
###  Level 1
**[Level 1 - Follow](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-9/responsibilities/level-1):** Essence of the level: Performs routine tasks under close supervision, follows instructions, and requires guidance to complete their work. Learns and applies basic skills and knowledge. 
###  Hardware design: Level 2
**[Level 2 - Assist](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-9/responsibilities/level-2):** Essence of the level: Provides assistance to others, works under routine supervision, and uses their discretion to address routine problems. Actively learns through training and on-the-job experiences. 
* * *
Assists in designing simple hardware components or subsystems under guidance. 
Follows established design principles, patterns and methodologies as directed. Participates in translating logical designs into physical implementations. 
Tests hardware components or subsystems against provided specifications and documents results. Contributes to the documentation of hardware designs using required standards, methods and tools. 
Seeks guidance and support for deviations from standard practices or when facing unfamiliar scenarios.
###  Hardware design: Level 3
**[Level 3 - Apply](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-9/responsibilities/level-3):** Essence of the level: Performs varied tasks, sometimes complex and non-routine, using standard methods and procedures.

Submits hardware designs for approval. Documents all work using required standards, methods and tools.
###  Hardware design: Level 4
**[Level 4 - Enable](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-9/responsibilities/level-4):** Essence of the level: Performs diverse complex activities, supports and guides others, delegates tasks when appropriate, works autonomously under general direction, and contributes expertise to deliver team objectives. 
* * *
Designs hardware components, taking account of target environment, performance, security, safety, reliability and sustainability requirements. 
Translates logical designs into physical designs and delivers technical prototypes of proposed components for approval and production. 
Designs the tests to measure the performance of prototypes and production output against specification and inform iterative development.
###  Hardware design: Level 5
**[Level 5 - Ensure, advise](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-9/responsibilities/level-5):** Essence of the level: Provides authoritative guidance in their field and works under broad direction. Accountable for delivering significant work outcomes, from analysis through execution to evaluation.
