### Guidance notes
This skill is inclusive of a full range of user tasks not just digital tasks. The skill can be applied in various contexts, such as, but not limited to customer experience, products, services, applications, devices, learning experience and employee experience.
Evaluation is typically part of an iterative user experience design process and contributes to the improvement of the product or service. An evaluation can also be the starting point if an existing system, product or service is to be replaced or improved. Methods include user trials, expert review, survey and analysis.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * providing assurance that user stories or requirements have been met and required practice has been followed to address accessibility, usability, security, health and safety
  * applying a range of qualitative and quantitative evaluation techniques
  * selecting from lightweight/rapid techniques or more thorough and resource-intensive approaches
  * selecting appropriate use of formative or summative evaluations
  * facilitating both moderated and unmoderated tests.
