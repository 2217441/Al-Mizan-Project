### Guidance notes
Configuration items (CIs) can include a wide variety of components (objects) such as, but not limited to, source code, software, products, systems, hardware, networks, buildings, suppliers, process definitions and documents. A coherent set of CIs forms a configuration.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * identifying and documenting the functional and physical characteristics of CIs
  * identifying the relationships and maintain coherence between CIs for specific configurations
  * identifying the associated configuration(s), status, version and other characteristics of CIs at distinct points in time
  * controlling changes to CI characteristics, recording and reporting change processing and implementation status
  * systematically controlling changes to a configuration and maintaining the integrity, coherence and traceability of that configuration throughout the project, system and/or service lifecycle
  * adhering to established safety, security and quality standards
  * verifying and auditing CI records for data quality and compliance with specified internal and external requirements.
