### Guidance notes
Data modelling supports activities such as, but not limited to:
  * helping organisations understand their data assets, develop software systems and map relationships between real-world entities
  * engaging with stakeholders to gather requirements and ensure data models align with business objectives
  * facilitating data engineering, integration and interoperability
  * enhancing data retrieval
  * supporting data governance and master data management
  * incorporating industry reference data standards to ensure consistency, interoperability and compliance.


Data models typically include components such as entities, relationships, attributes and domains. There are various types of data models, including relational, object-oriented, NoSQL and time-based.
Data models communicate different levels of detail, including conceptual, logical and physical. 
###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
