###  Revision notes
**Updates for SFIA 9**
  * This is a new skill introduced in SFIA 9.
  * Theme(s) influencing the updates for this new skill: Support for specialised domains in the field of testing.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping of other SFIA skills may be impacted by this new skill. See also [Functional testing](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/TEST), [Penetration testing](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/PENT) and [User experience evaluation](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/USEV).


### Guidance notes
Non-functional testing assesses the behaviour of technology, system components, configurations and packages, ensuring they work together to support the system's operation. It focuses on identifying and mitigating risks related to system qualities and characteristics, such as performance, security, backup and recovery, availability, scalability, reliability, maintainability, monitoring, resource efficiency and compliance with technical standards.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * collaborating with stakeholders to clarify non-functional requirements and expectations
  * setting up test environments that mirror production conditions, simulating real-world usage
  * preparing and managing test data to accurately represent necessary variety and volumes
  * designing and executing stress, load, security and other non-functional tests
  * troubleshooting issues during testing, coordinating with technical teams to resolve problems
  * participating in reviews to refine non-functional requirements, identifying risks and suggesting enhancements
  * analysing results to assess system performance, security and other key qualities, providing insights for improvement
  * promoting a shift-left approach by integrating non-functional testing early in the lifecycle for early issue detection
  * adapting testing strategies to suit various development methodologies
  * developing and maintaining automated tests, monitoring systems and frameworks to continuously assess system quality and performance
  * ensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and recognised good practices.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
