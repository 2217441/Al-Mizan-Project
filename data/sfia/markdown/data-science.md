###  Revision notes
**Updates for SFIA 9**
  * Theme(s) influencing the updates for this skill: Continued refinement for data and analytics skills.
  * Level 7 has been moved to a new skill - [Data analytics](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/DAAN)
  * Content and/or readability changes have been made to levels 2, 4, 5, and 6.
  * You can move to SFIA 9 when you are ready - SFIA 8 skill descriptions will still be available to use.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping may be impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Data science is typically used for analysing high volume, high velocity and high variety data (numbers, symbols, text, sound and image).
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * integrating methods from mathematics, statistics and probability modelling using specialised programming languages, tools and techniques
  * sourcing and preparing data for analysis
  * identifying, validating and exploiting internal and external data sets generated from a diverse range of processes
  * developing forward-looking, predictive, real-time, model-based insights to create value and drive effective decision-making
  * finding, selecting, acquiring and ingesting data sources
  * integrating and cleansing data to make it fit for purpose
  * developing hypotheses and exploring data using models and analytics sandboxes
  * refining requirements, validating, training and evolving models over time to discover deeper insights, make predictions or generate recommendations
  * using advanced analytic techniques including, but not limited to: data/text mining, machine learning, pattern matching, forecasting, visualisation, semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, network and cluster analysis, multivariate statistics, graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing and neural networks.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
