### Guidance notes
System software encompasses a wide range of software components that support the functioning and management of technology infrastructure, including operating systems, infrastructure software, data management products, office automation products, middleware and utility software. It may run in cloud, virtual or physical hardware environments and enables applications to run effectively.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * monitoring and optimising the performance of system software
  * developing and maintaining diagnostic tools and procedures for system software troubleshooting and performance analysis
  * resolving service problems with system software components
  * evaluating, provisioning and testing new system software, including cloud based solutions 
  * reviewing system software updates and upgrades
  * provisioning and testing system software updates and configurations
  * adhering to established safety, security and quality standards
  * managing system software in hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
