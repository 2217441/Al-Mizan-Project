###  Revision notes
**Updates for SFIA 9**
  * Theme(s) influencing the updates for this skill: Software engineering, Application of SFIA skills for cloud-based working, Making SFIA easier to consume (enhance readability/guidance/descriptions), Making SFIA easier to consume (updates to skill name/skill description).
  * Added reference to software architecture
  * Content changes have been made to levels 2, 4, and 6.
  * You can move to SFIA 9 when you are ready - SFIA 8 skill descriptions will still be available to use.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * designing and architecting software applications, components, interfaces and related characteristics (including security)
  * designing for scalability, performance, resilience, security and privacy from the outset, aligned with cloud computing, distributed systems and data protection
  * applying design concepts, patterns, modelling techniques and architectural styles such as microservices, serverless and domain-driven design to develop software designs and architectures, which serve as the foundation for software construction and verification
  * evaluating alternative solutions and trade-offs to facilitate design decisions
  * considering functional and non-functional requirements such as the target environment, performance, security, scalability and integration with existing systems
  * adopting and adapting software design models, tools and techniques based on the context of the work, including contemporary practices such as cloud-native architectures, edge computing, cyber-physical systems and agile and iterative design practices
  * developing prototypes/simulations to enable informed decision-making.


Unlike programming and designing at the code level, this skill focuses on higher-level design, addressing architecture and system-wide considerations.
###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
