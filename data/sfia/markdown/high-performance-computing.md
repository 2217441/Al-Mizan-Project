### Guidance notes
High-performance computing (HPC) is the use of super computers and parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. HPC technology focuses on developing parallel processing algorithms and systems.
High-performance computing is typically used for solving advanced problems and performing research activities through computer modelling, simulation and analysis. Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * designing and optimising parallel algorithms
  * managing and maintaining HPC infrastructures
  * developing software for HPC environments
  * conducting performance analysis and optimisation of HPC applications
  * collaborating with researchers to translate scientific problems into HPC solutions.


HPC technology is implemented in a variety of disciplines including, but not limited to:
  * biosciences and molecular modelling
  * geographical data
  * oil and gas exploration
  * climate modelling and weather forecasting
  * physical simulations
  * cryptanalysis.


The terms high-performance computing and supercomputing are sometimes used interchangeably.
###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
