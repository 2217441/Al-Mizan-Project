###  Revision notes
**Updates for SFIA 9**
  * Theme(s) influencing the updates for this skill: Making SFIA easier to consume (enhance readability/guidance/descriptions), Support for cyber security working practices (both specialised and general).
  * Readability improvements have been made to level 2.
  * You can move to SFIA 9 when you are ready - SFIA 8 skill descriptions will still be available to use.
  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * identifying, creating and applying software development and security standards and processes
  * planning and designing software components
  * estimating time and effort required for software development
  * constructing, amending, and verifying software components, ensuring security is embedded
  * applying test-driven development and ensuring appropriate test coverage
  * using peer review techniques such as pair programming
  * documenting software components
  * understanding and obtaining agreement to the value of the software components to be developed
  * selecting appropriate development methods and lifecycles
  * applying recovery techniques to ensure the software being developed is not lost 
  * implementing appropriate change control to software development practices
  * resolving operational problems with software and fixing bugs


Depending on requirements and the characteristics of the project or assigned work, software development methods and lifecycles can be predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.
###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
