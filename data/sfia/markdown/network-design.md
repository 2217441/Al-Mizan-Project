### Guidance notes
Network design covers all aspects of the communications infrastructure, including, but not limited to: networks that are wired or wireless, digital or analogue, virtual or physical, local area, wide area, mobile/cellular and any other defined protocols and scales of operation. In the cloud context, network design also includes designing virtual network topologies, hybrid cloud connectivity and leveraging cloud-native networking services to ensure scalability, security and performance. 
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * analysing business requirements and translating them into network design specifications
  * designing network topologies, security measures and connectivity solutions for various environments
  * defining network configurations and policies using code
  * planning for network scalability, redundancy and high availability, including in cloud-based networks
  * defining network infrastructure as code to enable automation and streamline provisioning and management
  * designing disaster recovery and business continuity solutions to ensure network resilience and minimise downtime
  * collaborating with stakeholders to ensure network designs align with business objectives and industry standards.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
