  * Previous SFIA assessments or skills mapping are not impacted by this change.


### Guidance notes
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * identifying data sources, data processing concepts and methods
  * evaluating, designing and implementing on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid data engineering solutions
  * structuring and storing data for analytics, machine learning, data mining and sharing with applications and organisations
  * harvesting structured and unstructured data
  * integrating, consolidating and cleansing data
  * implementing real-time and batch data processing pipelines
  * ensuring compliance with data governance, security and privacy standards, including encryption and secure multi-tenancy
  * managing continuous integration, deployment and monitoring of data pipelines (DataOps)
  * migrating and converting data
  * applying ethical principles in handling data
  * ensuring data storage aligns with relevant legislation
  * building in security, compliance, scalability, efficiency, reliability, fidelity, flexibility and portability to data engineering solutions.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
