### Guidance notes
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * condensing and encapsulating data characteristics, making it easier to surface opportunities, identify risks, analyse trends and drive effective decision-making
  * presenting findings and data insights in creative ways to facilitate the understanding of data across a range of technical and non-technical audiences
  * developing narratives and storytelling around data to enhance understanding and support decision-making.


The skill is typically put into practice by using specialist analytics tools. Specialisation in this skill implies a requirement to use more than just standard office software to create graphical representations of simple data.
