### Guidance notes
Governance can be applied to specific activities or may be a single integrated framework across an organisation.
Specialisms include, but are not limited to, security, information, technology, architectures, enterprise IT and service management.
An organisation’s obligations may be external or internal including, but not limited to: legislative, regulatory, contractual and adherence to agreed standards/policies or ethical frameworks. 
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * defining and operating the system of rules, practices and processes by which an organisation makes decisions, manages stakeholders’ relationships and identifies legitimate authority
  * integrating risk management into governance frameworks to support informed decision-making
  * determining how to direct, evaluate and monitor an organisation’s activities
  * developing and operating strategic and operational frameworks, policies, decision-making, business processes and plans to meet stakeholder requirements
  * ensuring alignment between governance practices and organisational strategy
  * establishing and maintaining governance committees and reporting structures.


Governance is explicitly referenced in many SFIA skills. Professionals may contribute specialist knowledge to governance processes, reviews and developments, but that does not imply they need the SFIA skill of Governance.
