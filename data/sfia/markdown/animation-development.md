### Guidance notes
Animation development enables the creation of visually engaging and interactive experiences for various industries, such as gaming, training, scientific research and engineering, as well as virtual reality and augmented reality applications.
Components of animation systems include game engine or framework, visual assets (3D models, 2D artwork, animations), audio assets, user interface and user experience components, game logic, data and configuration files, tools and pipelines, documentation and design documents
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * employing animation techniques, including keyframe animation, motion capture, procedural animation and skeletal animation
  * using specialised software for rigging, skinning and animation editing
  * creating and integrating animations into interactive systems
  * ensuring integration of animations with game logic, physics and artificial intelligence systems
  * optimising animations for performance and adhering to consistency and quality standards.


###  Understanding the responsibility levels of this skill
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
  * Specific tasks and responsibilities are not defined because the skill requires a higher level of autonomy, influence, and complexity in decision-making than is typically expected at these levels. You can use the essence statements to understand the generic responsibilities associated with these levels.


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * Responsibilities and accountabilities are not defined because these higher levels involve strategic leadership and broader organisational influence that goes beyond the scope of this specific skill. See the essence statements.


#### Developing skills and demonstrating responsibilities related to this skill
The defined levels show the incremental progression in skills and responsibilities.
##### Where lower levels are not defined...
You can develop your knowledge and support others who do have responsibility in this area by:
  * Learning key concepts and principles related to this skill and its impact on your role
  * Performing related skills (see the related SFIA skills)
  * Supporting others who are performing higher level tasks and activities


##### Where higher levels are not defined...
  * You can progress by developing related skills which are better suited to higher levels of organisational leadership.
