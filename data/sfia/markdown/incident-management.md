  * establishing incident response teams or security incident response teams
  * enhancing preparedness through regular testing, training, simulations and development of incident response plans and playbooks
  * restoring service to users as quickly as possible, prioritising service continuity over permanent solutions
  * managing unplanned interruptions to a service or reductions in service quality

Incidents can impact areas such as business operations, information and cyber security, IT systems, services, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.
Different roles or groups may be needed to diagnose and resolve incidents. These can include users, subject matter experts, service desk staff, support teams, suppliers, and partners. Although they participate in the incident management process, they do not necessarily require incident management skills.
