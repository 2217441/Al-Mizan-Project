### Guidance notes
Activities may include, but are not limited to:
  * generating and defining options
  * ensuring options align with the organisation’s vision, mission, objectives, strategy and tactics
  * engaging with relevant stakeholders and specialists
  * evaluating options for financial, technical and business feasibility.


Feasibility assessment is multi-dimensional. Options for change must be evaluated from several dimensions including, but not limited to: financial, technical, organisational capability and culture, strategic context, economic and/or commercial environment.
Feasibility assessment typically results in a documented business case used to support organisational decision-making about proposed investments. This skill is focused on the generation, analysis and documentation of investment options.
